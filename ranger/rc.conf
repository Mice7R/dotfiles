# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create either /etc/ranger/rc.conf
# (system-wide) or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf (per user) and add your custom
# commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Which files should be hidden? (regular expression)
set hidden_filter ^\.|\.(?:pyc|pyo|bak|swp)$|^lost\+found$|^__(py)?cache__$

# Use non-default path for file preview script?
# ranger ships with scope.sh, a script that calls external programs (see
# README.md for dependencies) to preview images, archives, etc.
#set preview_script ~/.config/ranger/scope.sh

# Use one of the supported image preview protocols
set preview_images false

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * w3m (default):
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "w3mimgpreview"?
#   This requires the console web browser "w3m" and a supported terminal.
#   It has been successfully tested with "xterm" and "urxvt" without tmux.
#
# * iterm2:
#   Preview images in full color using iTerm2 image previews
#   (http://iterm2.com/images.html). This requires using iTerm2 compiled
#   with image preview support.
#
#   This feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a
#   width of 8 and height of 11 are used.  To use other values, set the options
#   iterm2_font_width and iterm2_font_height to the desired values.
#
# * terminology:
#   Previews images in full color in the terminology terminal emulator.
#   Supports a wide variety of formats, even vector graphics like svg.
#
# * urxvt:
#   Preview images in full color using urxvt image backgrounds. This
#   requires using urxvt compiled with pixbuf support.
#
# * urxvt-full:
#   The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the
#   whole terminal window.
#
# * kitty:
#   Preview images in full color using kitty image protocol.
#   Requires python PIL or pillow library.
#   If ranger does not share the local filesystem with kitty
#   the transfer method is changed to encode the whole image;
#   while slower, this allows remote previews,
#   for example during an ssh session.
#   Tmux is unsupported.
set preview_images_method w3m

# Delay in seconds before displaying an image with the w3m method.
# Increase it in case of experiencing display corruption.

# Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
# default, jungle, snow, solarized

# Flush the input after each key hit?  (Noticeable when ranger lags)

# Padding on the right when there's no preview?
# This allows you to click into the space to run the file.

# Use fuzzy tab completion with the "cd" command. For example,
# ":cd /u/lo/b<tab>" expands to ":cd /usr/local/bin".

# Avoid previewing files larger than this size, in bytes.  Use a value of 0 to
# disable this feature.

# Clear all existing filters when leaving a directory
set clear_filters_on_dir_change false

# Save tabs on exit

# Enable scroll wrapping - moving down while on the last item will wrap around to
# the top and vice versa.
set wrap_scroll false

# Set the global_inode_type_filter to nothing.  Possible options: d, f and l for
# directories, files and symlinks respectively.
set global_inode_type_filter

# This setting allows to freeze the list of files to save I/O bandwidth.  It
# should be 'false' during start-up, but you can toggle it by pressing F.
